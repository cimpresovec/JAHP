JAHP
A game by Luka Horvat (redreaper132(at)gmail.com)
---------------------

JAHP was a bigger project of mine back in the day. It's inspired
by Super Meat Boy, Jumper, etc.

---------------------

You need SDL, SDL_image, OpenGL and FMOD to compile.

---------------------

There is a 6 second pause in the init() function because
some weird FMOD loading bug I had when I was developing it.
Take the pause out if you don't need it.

The music is excluded, it wasn't mine so I don't want any license problems.

---------------------

Have fun.
