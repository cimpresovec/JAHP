D: move right
W: jump

//// ABOUT ////

Game is made in C++ using SDL, OpenGL and Fmod. The idea came from games like
Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy, Jumper series, F(l)ail, ...

//// EDITOR INFO ////

The editor is really simple. Use arrow keys to navigate the map, button 1 - 9 
to select items (yellow block is spawn point, white block does nothing). 
Level is saved using the 0 button. It is saved as level 0 in the levels map.
You have to replace one of the levels (usually level 1) to play it.
Use "e" to erase all block, because erasing them all by hand crashes the game.

The editor is only for the curious ones. Not made for any public use.
